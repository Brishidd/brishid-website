        <h2>About Ceremonial Matcha</h2>
        <p>Ceremonial matcha is the highest grade of matcha, made from the youngest tea leaves that are shade‑grown to enhance their sweetness. These leaves are carefully stone-ground into a fine, bright green powder with a subtle sweetness and umami flavor. Ceremonial matcha has a delicate flavor profile with little bitterness, making it perfect for traditional tea ceremonies and for enjoying on its own.</p>
        <p>Our Ceremonial Grade Matcha is sourced from select farms and carefully processed to ensure maximum freshness and quality. Each tin delivers a smooth, vibrant brew that reflects centuries of Japanese tea heritage.</p>

        <h2>How to Prepare</h2>
        <p>Use a bamboo whisk to gently combine ceremonial matcha with hot water (approximately 80°C). Whisk in an "M" motion until a frothy layer forms on top. Enjoy immediately to appreciate the fresh aroma and rich, creamy flavor.</p>
